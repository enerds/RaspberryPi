This seems to be just another PHP Webclient for Music Player Daemon (http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/). 
But it is the continuation of the existing projects phpMp, phpMp+, phpMp2, phpMp3 and thus as stable as them,
although new an shiny. Simple and easy to use. New clients are welcome.

There is a huge number of webclients based on php for mpd out there. The project is going to join them into
one client collection. So each player is selectable through a nice selector. 

Projects which are already included in phpMpReloded:
  - phpMp
  - phpMp+
  - phpMp2
  - phpMp3
  - IPodMp
  - MPD-Web-Remote


Do you want your webclient include into phpMpReloded?
