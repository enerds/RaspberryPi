This little board will communicate via serial with the RaspberryPi.
The core will be a simple atmega8.
We will have the three PWMs,
six ADCs and some additional in/output pins.

All GPIO pins of the Raspberry that are not used for the communication with the
atmega will be usable from connectors of the extension board.
